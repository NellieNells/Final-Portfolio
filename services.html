            <h3>Graphics</h3>
            <p>Requesting a graphic of any type can be commissioned through me. Depending on what
                the graphic is, I will charge accordingly for it. The smaller it is, the cheaper and vice versa.
                I can make logos, posters, covers, etc, as long as you state what it is that you want to be included.
                Please be descriptive as possible and be patient with me to get the works done in a timely fashion.
                Payment will vary after we've discussed together.
            </p>
